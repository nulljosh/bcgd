# Bcgd Roadmap

## Blocked on Joshua — file the 4.3(a) appeal (needs a browser)

Resolution Center is web-only; `asc web review` is read-only, so there is no CLI path.
Reply text is written and verified: `~/Documents/Code/notes/appeal-4-3-spam.md`. Paste it by hand at
appstoreconnect.com. Order: Talli first (strongest — 3.5.7 through 3.5.12 were each
approved, 3.5.13 is maintenance only), then Curvely, then Doorstock (answer 3.2's
numbered questions literally as well).

Do NOT resubmit any rejected build before the appeal gets a verdict.
Do NOT open a second developer account — Apple's letter names multi-account submission
as a spam factor.

## Rejected 2026-08-27 — iOS 1.0 rejected (4.3a Spam + earlier 3.2), appeals filed

iOS rejected on TWO separate violations. First: Guideline 3.2 Business Model (2026-08-27 review noted the app is for "Best Choice Garage Doors" internal use, not public distribution). Chose to de-brand as "Doorstock" public contractor tool; resubmitted same day. Second rejection received same day: Guideline 4.3(a) Design: Spam (account-level pattern with four other apps: Sparkjar, NYC Survive, Talli, Curvely — all submitted 2026-08-26). Two separate appeals filed 2026-08-27 via Resolution Center. macOS 1.0 remains READY_FOR_SALE unaffected (de-branding was iOS-only to preserve the approved macOS listing). Do not attempt resubmit; monitor appeal verdicts only.

## Done 2026-08-18 — submit-ready
`asc validate` clean on **both** iOS 1.0 (`df882260-865d-4f33-9735-dc9f8137bcde`) and macOS 1.0
(`ef1421dd-4c4b-4592-a8be-a4fc0db4c149`): 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 blocking.

Fixed today: both builds were missing the encryption declaration (`build.encryption.missing`, the
only blocking error on either row). Set `usesNonExemptEncryption=false` on builds
`e4da322e-12a0-4720-b914-6d9019f4a3af` (iOS) and `29b59afc-47fb-4a3a-8365-43b73dbcddb4` (macOS),
matching every sibling app in the fleet — HTTPS-only traffic is exempt.

Held for the four in-flight verdicts, not for any missing work.

- [ ] **Blocked on Joshua (dashboard only), do before the first submit.** BCGD carries a stray empty
  review submission `59cef0f7-188d-4ab8-bb6b-6c4c3f37239b` (IOS, READY_FOR_REVIEW, no submittedDate,
  zero items). `asc review submissions-cancel --confirm` refuses it: "Resource is not in cancellable
  state." Same defect Curvely has. Clear it in App Store Connect before submitting 1.0, or the real
  submission may collide with it.

## OAuth rollout (2026-08-24)
- [ ] **EXCLUDED — Supabase signInWithOAuth auto-creates users on first sign-in.** Dashboard has no signUp (accounts are hand-provisioned by admin only). Adding a GitHub auth button would let any GitHub account self-provision admin access, a security risk. Blocker: email allowlist gate needed in auth.js before any OAuth button ships.

## Submit attempt 2026-08-18 — now BLOCKED on App Privacy only (both platforms)

The Guideline 5.6 date freeze expired 2026-08-18 and BCGD was never one of the four
suspended apps, so it is clear to ship. Attempted iOS 1.0 submission
(`asc review submit --app 6791106082 --version 1.0 --platform IOS --build 798bbe86-b5f5-46e4-bb3d-633a74307236 --confirm`).
**It failed.** Three blockers were found; **two are now closed** (pricing, screenshots) and
**one remains: App Privacy, which needs Joshua.** Caution that still applies: `asc validate` on
iOS reported 0 errors / 0 warnings even while the submit call was failing on all three, so it
under-reports. Trust the real submit call, not validate. As of 2026-08-18 the only *known*
remaining blocker is App Privacy — but that has not been proven by a submit call, because no
third App Store submission should be queued until Curvely or Wiretext clears review.

- [ ] **App Privacy data usages not published** — `You must have published answers to your app's
      data usages`. Public API cannot do this. Needs `asc web privacy pull|plan|apply|publish --app 6791106082`,
      which needs a live `asc web auth login` (interactive 2FA — **Joshua only**). Web fallback:
      https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps/6791106082/appPrivacy
      The app is a fully local SwiftUI inventory/jobs tracker — `Store` persists to UserDefaults,
      no network calls, no accounts, no analytics — so the correct answer is **DATA_NOT_COLLECTED**.
- [ ] **More macOS screenshots (Inventory / Jobs / Settings) — only Dashboard shipped.** One shot
      satisfies Apple's minimum and unblocks submission, but the listing is thin. Blocked on the
      same thing as always: switching tabs needs a real click, and `TabView` here has no selection
      binding to persist, so there is no defaults-only way to land on another tab. Cheapest honest
      options if this matters: add a `@SceneStorage`/`selection` binding to the macOS `TabView`
      (then each tab is one defaults write + relaunch + capture), or accept a click-driven pass.
      Also worth knowing: the Dashboard shot is very whitespace-heavy at 1280x800 — the Mac layout
      genuinely looks like that, so richer screenshots probably want a design pass, not a capture
      trick.

Notes for whoever picks this up:
- iOS build `798bbe86-b5f5-46e4-bb3d-633a74307236` (build 1, uploaded 2026-07-15) is VALID,
  attached, encryption-exempt, and **expires 2026-10-13** — re-upload if that date passes.
- A stray empty review submission `59cef0f7-188d-4ab8-bb6b-6c4c3f37239b` (READY_FOR_REVIEW,
  0 items) now exists from the failed attempt. Harmless — `asc review submit` reuses it. Same
  litter pattern as Curvely's stray. Verify items with `asc review items list --submission ID`;
  `asc review submissions-list` misreports the Items count as 0.
- Not acted on: the iOS app uses `bcgdTeal` (#1B5959) as its tint, which conflicts with the
  standing "no teal" colour rule. It is the client's brand colour, so this is Joshua's call,
  not a lint fix.
- Not acted on: `src/ios/project.yml` has `MARKETING_VERSION: 0.1.0` while the ASC version is
  1.0, so the app's own Settings screen reports 0.1.0. Harmless to reviewers (they see the ASC
  version), but it kept the Settings tab out of the screenshot set. `src/macos/project.yml` is
  already correct at "1.0". Fixing means a yml bump + rebuild + re-upload of the iOS binary,
  which would replace the currently VALID attached build — deliberately not done mid-submission.
- Superseded: `src/ios/screenshots/*.png` (dashboard/inventory/jobs/settings, 1206x2622) are
  iPhone 6.3" captures, not an Apple 6.5" size. They are already uploaded to ASC under a
  different display type and were left alone; the 6.5" set is the new
  `src/ios/screenshots/appstore/` tree.

## ASC state VERIFIED 2026-08-12 (`asc versions list`)

**The ASC record exists** — app id `6791106082`, iOS 1.0 and macOS 1.0 both
`PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION`. Notes elsewhere saying "no ASC registration yet" are wrong.
Nothing is submitted, so nothing is rejected; this is the cleanest app in the fleet.

Freeze lifted 2026-08-18 (Guideline 5.6 suspension expired). Submitted that day and now
WAITING_FOR_REVIEW: Curvely iOS 1.2.0, Wiretext iOS 1.1.0, Wordroot iOS 1.0, Healstack iOS 2.3.4.
**Held pending those four verdicts — never a batch:** Sparkjar iOS+Mac, BCGD iOS+Mac, Wordroot Mac,
Lexly Mac. All six are `asc validate` clean (0 errors, 0 blocking) with a VALID build attached, so
each is one `asc review submit` away. Do not submit until the in-flight verdicts land.

## Done 2026-08-02
Merge doc comparison complete — verified bcgd.heyitsmejosh.com against bcgaragedoors.ca and found all major recommendations already shipped (hero booking form, pricing, stats bar, founder photo/bio, service pages for springs/cable/rollers/keypads/clickers/panels/weather-strips/hinge/maintenance). Only gap: track repair page. Added service entry to web/data/services.json, regenerated all pages via `node build.js`, deployed to Cloudflare Pages, and pushed. Commit e9f5c1c.

## Done 2026-07-27
Site/dashboard comparison against bcgaragedoors.ca, then the fixes:
- Booking form was discarding every lead (`alert()` + reset). Now inserts into
  `bcgd_leads` on the shared spark Supabase project; dashboard imports them as
  Lead jobs. Verified end to end via the REST API (anon insert 201, anon select
  denied, authed select returns the row).
- 11 service pages + 12 service-area pages + sitemap generated by
  `web/build.js`; JSON-LD, OG meta, robots.txt, real 404. Site previously had
  zero indexable URLs.
- Dashboard: Supabase auth replaced the 4-digit PIN gate, Today view, jobs
  carry a parts list deducted on Complete. Deleted orphaned `Dashboard.jsx`
  (was never imported -- dead code).
- **Deploy target was wrong in CLAUDE.md**: both sites are Cloudflare Pages,
  not Vercel. Corrected.

### Open follow-ups
> Session 2026-08-13 stopped here — usage limit near cap (`weekly_all 88% WARNING`).
> Everything still open below is untouched.

- [ ] Dashboard React wiring (sign-in -> lead import -> Today render) is only
      verified by build + headless render of the gate, not a full browser run.
      A CDP script was written at scratchpad `e2e.mjs` but not executed (usage
      cap). Re-run or click through once manually.
- [ ] Shop login is `shop@bcgaragedoors.ca`; password was generated and shown
      in chat 2026-07-27 -- change it via Settings > Security.
- [ ] Parts/jobs still localStorage; only leads are server-side. Migrate when
      the iOS app needs the same stock.
- [ ] Reorder is still per-part mailto; grouping by supplier with an
      ordered/received state was planned but not built.

## Source-site gap audit 2026-08-03
Rendered bcgaragedoors.ca live in Chrome (static curl is bot-protected/JS-rendered, confirmed dead end). Compared against `src/web/` (12 service pages + 12 service-area pages, already matches the source's city list 1:1 — Langley, Surrey, Vancouver, Burnaby, Coquitlam, New Westminster, Maple Ridge, Richmond, Delta, Abbotsford, North/West Vancouver). Homepage messaging (family-owned/repair-focused/no-pressure, LiftMaster-compatible parts) already carried over per the 2026-08-02 merge. Remaining real gaps, not yet ported:
- [ ] "Our Seamless Service Process" 5-step section (Thorough System Inspection → Clear Explanation and Service Plan → Precision Service Completion → Safety Testing and Performance Check → Final Review and Clean Completion) — bcgd's process copy is thinner than this on the homepage.
- [ ] "Practical Benefits" section (Reduced Repeat Issues, Improved Safety and Stability, Smoother and Quieter Operation, Less Strain on Mechanical Components, Clear Expectations and Professional Service) — not present on bcgd homepage.
- [ ] Source splits Cable/Roller service into separate Repair vs. Replacement pages (and has a standalone Torsion Spring Repair page); bcgd combines these into single `garage-door-cable`/`garage-door-rollers`/`garage-door-springs` pages — a deliberate simplification, not a bug, but flag if 1:1 replication is still the goal.
- [ ] Source FAQ has 10 specific Q&As (appointment duration, coverage area, emergency availability, booking method, pricing factors, maintenance frequency, spring/cable handling, panel repair, DIY-vs-pro) — bcgd has an FAQ section but content wasn't diffed line-by-line this pass; worth a follow-up check against bcgd's actual FAQ copy.

## App Privacy PUBLISHED — 2026-08-18

Closed with a live 2FA web session (Joshua supplied the code). The declaration existed locally but
had never been applied remotely, so `asc web privacy publish` returned
`409 STATE_ERROR.APP_DATA_USAGES_REQUIRED`. Correct sequence is **apply, then publish** — a bare
publish on an app that has no remote data-usage tuples always 409s:

```
asc web privacy plan   --app 6791106082 --file privacy.json   # adds: ||DATA_NOT_COLLECTED
asc web privacy apply  --app 6791106082 --file privacy.json
asc web privacy publish --app 6791106082 --confirm
```

where `privacy.json` is `{"schemaVersion":1,"dataUsages":[{"dataProtections":["DATA_NOT_COLLECTED"]}]}`
(identical to Wordroot's published declaration). Verified: `published: true`.

## Submit decision 2026-08-18 — HOLD, with one real defect to fix first

Both platforms are otherwise ready: App Privacy published, pricing set (free/CAN), iPhone 6.5" ×3
and Mac 1280×800 ×1 uploaded, `asc validate` 0 errors / 0 warnings / 1 info on each. Versions sit at
`PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION`.

Not submitted today, for two reasons:

- [ ] **`MARKETING_VERSION`: source is FIXED, the attached build is NOT.** Re-checked 2026-08-24.
      `src/ios/project.yml:16` now reads `MARKETING_VERSION: "1.0"` (commit `8b74c5d`, 2026-08-18
      12:55:50 -0700, "read version from bundle instead of hardcoding"). But the attached build is
      `202608181253` — cut at 12:53, **two minutes before that commit** — so the uploaded binary
      still renders "Version 0.1.0" in the Settings tab. Do NOT close this item just because the yml
      looks right. Remaining work is only: rebuild, re-upload (replaces the currently VALID build),
      then submit. `src/macos/project.yml` was already correct.
      Ordering: per `wiki/pages/ship-plan.md`, do not submit BCGD while the Healstack verdict is
      outstanding — never a batch.
- Queue discipline: `wiki/pages/ship-plan.md` § "Order of operations" step 5 — one app at a time.
  Wordroot went in today, and Curvely + Wiretext are already in review. Adding BCGD makes four.

Also worth doing before the macOS submit, not blocking: the Mac listing carries a single Dashboard
screenshot. Adding a selection binding to the `TabView` would allow capturing the other tabs.

**Note:** the earlier "App Privacy is the only remaining blocker" line above is superseded — it was
published 2026-08-18, see the section above it.

## Version defect fixed + both platforms rebuilt and uploaded — 2026-08-18

**The recorded diagnosis was half the story.** `MARKETING_VERSION: 0.1.0` in `src/ios/project.yml`
was real, but fixing it alone would NOT have fixed the Settings tab: the version was **hardcoded**
as a string literal in `Views.swift:167`, on **both** platforms:

```swift
LabeledContent("Version", value: "0.1.0")     // ios AND macos
```

So macOS displayed `0.1.0` too, despite its yml having always said `1.0` — the earlier note that
"`src/macos/project.yml` is already correct" was true and still left the Mac app showing the wrong
version. Both now read the bundle, so the displayed version tracks `MARKETING_VERSION` and cannot
drift again:

```swift
LabeledContent("Version", value: Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["CFBundleShortVersionString"] as? String ?? "")
```

### macOS ITMS-90242 was present here too, and is now fixed
BCGD's Mac archive had the **same defect that blocked Wordroot's Mac build three times**: automatic
signing signed the `.app` with `Apple Development` while the installer was correctly signed with
`3rd Party Mac Developer Installer`. Verified with `codesign -dvvv` on the archive before uploading,
which is worth doing every time — the upload would otherwise have failed on Apple's side.

Fix was export-side only, no manual signing style and no provisioning profile juggling. Added to
`src/macos/ExportOptions.plist`:

```xml
<key>signingCertificate</key><string>3rd Party Mac Developer Application</string>
<key>installerSigningCertificate</key><string>3rd Party Mac Developer Installer</string>
```

Confirmed by expanding the exported `.pkg` (`pkgutil --expand-full`) and re-running `codesign -dvvv`
on the app inside: now `3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Joshua Trommel`. **This same fix should
unblock wordroot's macOS build** — it is the identical failure.

### Trap waiting for whoever submits this

Not done, deliberately: no Settings screenshot was added. The uploaded set is Dashboard / Inventory /
Jobs, which already meets Apple's requirement, and there was no stale Settings shot to replace — a
settings screen is weak listing material. The Mac listing still carries only the one Dashboard shot;
capturing more still needs a selection binding on the `TabView`.

## 2026-08-23 — nothing has ever been submitted
Both iOS 1.0 and macOS 1.0 are Prepare for Submission. Both rows have been asc validate clean
since the 5.6 freeze lifted 2026-08-18 and were deliberately held back rather than batched with
the other submissions. That hold has no reason to continue.

### 2026-08-23 — BOTH PLATFORMS SUBMITTED
iOS 1.0 submission f1e5b07b and macOS 1.0 submission 3f07f62f, both WAITING_FOR_REVIEW ~10:19 UTC.
Builds 202608181253 (one per platform; `asc builds list` reports platform null, so filter with
`--platform`). Nothing was ever wrong with these — they validated clean and were simply never submitted.
`--version 1.0` resolves to the iOS record for both platforms, so the macOS submit needs
`--version-id ef1421dd-4c4b-4592-a8be-a4fc0db4c149`. Both hit the known false-negative
"does not contain target version" and were completed with `asc review submissions-submit --id ... --confirm`.

## 2026-08-26 — iOS 1.0 REJECTED, Guideline 3.2 (Business)
Submission `f1e5b07b-e414-4fb4-b484-780d25a18f90`, build 202608181253, reviewed on iPad Air 11".
Apple read the app as an internal tool for one business (name is literally "BC Garage Doors")
and says public App Store distribution is the wrong channel.

macOS 1.0 (`ef1421dd-...`) was APPROVED and is READY_FOR_SALE from the same codebase, so this is
a reviewer-judgment call, not a hard rule.

Pick one before resubmitting — this is a positioning decision, not a code fix:
- [ ] **Reply and appeal** (cheapest). Argue in the ASC reply that the app is a generic garage-door
      inventory/jobs tracker usable by any contractor, and cite the approved macOS build. Weak while
      the app name and branding say otherwise.
- [ ] **Rename + degeneralize.** Drop "BC" branding, ship as a generic garage-door/contractor job
      tracker. Real work: name (use asc-name-creator), icon, screenshots, metadata.
- [ ] **Move off public distribution.** Apple Business Manager custom app or TestFlight-only.
      Right answer if this only ever serves Best Choice Garage Doors.

## 2026-08-27 — de-branded to Doorstock, iOS resubmit in flight

Root cause of the 3.2 rejection was the **listing**, not the app. The pushed en-US description
opened with "Internal operations app for Best Choice Garage Doors" and marketingUrl pointed at
`bcgaragedoors.ca`. The Swift was already generic: local-only inventory/jobs, no network, no auth,
no client data, only three business strings in the whole app.

Chose **de-brand and resubmit** over appealing. Appealing meant arguing "this is really a public
app" while the listing said the opposite, and both platforms share one app record
(`com.joshuatrommel.bcgd`, Universal Purchase) — escalating 3.2 risked the live macOS listing.

Done:
- Name **Doorstock** (verified free, claimed). Applied to the REJECTED appInfo
  `390b0de9-9a6f-4264-b5b4-725e4a44a1e8` only. The live macOS appInfo
  `b3fd3c7c-0236-46e5-99d8-ed4cf6a2af73` still reads "BC Garage Doors" and was never touched.
- Both Swift trees de-branded and still byte-identical. Business phone row deleted.
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName: Doorstock`, build `202608271310`. Bundle ID unchanged —
  changing it would mean a new app record and forfeiting the live macOS listing.
- Support/marketing URL now `doorstock.heyitsmejosh.com` (new Cloudflare Pages project `doorstock`
  + proxied CNAME). The old URLs both led back to the single-business context.
- Canonical `metadata/en-US/` added; listing copy rewritten for a public audience.
- Review notes written — they were **completely empty** before, so the reviewer had only the name
  and description to judge intent by. That is half of why 3.2 landed.
- Screenshots regenerated on a `Doorstock-Shots` sim. Stale branded 6.1" set deleted outright.

Verified on device: low-stock flagging, full Lead → Quote → Scheduled → Complete → Paid pipeline,
and UserDefaults persistence across a relaunch.

**iOS 1.0 SUBMITTED 2026-08-27 20:22 UTC — WAITING_FOR_REVIEW**, build `202608271310` attached,
`asc validate` clean (0 errors, 0 blocking).

Two gotchas hit on the way, both worth remembering:
- `asc validate` blocked on "screenshot set APP_IPHONE_61 has no screenshots" after the stale
  branded 6.1" shots were deleted. An **empty** set is an error where **no set at all** is fine —
  DELETE the `appScreenshotSets` resource, don't just empty it.
- `asc review submit` refused with "review submission f1e5b07b is in state UNRESOLVED_ISSUES" and
  spawned a stray empty draft each attempt. The fix is not to create a new submission: mark the
  rejected submission's item resolved (`asc review items update --id <ITEM> --resolved true`),
  then `asc review submissions-submit --id f1e5b07b… --confirm` re-submits the original.

- [ ] Stray empty submission `c26a1e13-bcc4-4a08-9f80-d2421e7c35ea` (IOS, READY_FOR_REVIEW, zero
      items) left behind by the failed submit attempts. Not cancellable via CLI — same defect as the
      old `59cef0f7` one. **Blocked on Joshua:** clear it in the dashboard.
- [ ] **Align the macOS name on its next version bump.** Deliberately deferred: renaming macOS now
      needs a new version and a fresh trip through review, risking an approved listing for cosmetics.
- [ ] `whatsNew` cannot be set on a 1.0 initial release (ASC returns 409). Write it at 1.0.1.
- [ ] iOS rejected 4.3(a) Spam 2026-08-26. Appeal draft: ~/Documents/Code/notes/appeal-4-3-spam.md (Resolution Center, web only).

## From Notes (imported 2026-08-27)
- [ ] App Review flagged **Doorstock 1.0 for iOS** (submitted Aug 27 2026 01:22 PM PDT, submission `f1e5b07b-e414-4fb4-b484-780d25a18f90`). Get the reason via `asc web review show`, fix, resubmit.

### 4.3(a) status — verified 2026-08-27
  - Doorstock iOS 1.0 REJECTED on **two separate violations**: Guideline 3.2 (Business — reviewed as an internal app for one garage-door company), then **Guideline 4.3(a) Design: Spam** on the same-day resubmit after the de-brand to "Doorstock". Two appeals, both unfiled.
  - **Doorstock has never shipped on iOS**; macOS 1.0 remains READY_FOR_SALE as BC Garage Doors and is unaffected (the de-brand was iOS-only, deliberately, to preserve the approved macOS listing).
  - [ ] A stray submission `c26a1e13-bcc4-4a08-9f80-d2421e7c35ea` is sitting in READY_FOR_REVIEW with no submitted date — an API-started draft. Drafts are not cancellable via CLI; delete it in the ASC dashboard before any future submit.
  - **This is not a per-app content problem — do not fix code and do not resubmit.** Apple's letter is byte-identical boilerplate across all five with no named comparison app. Resubmitting the same build will fail again and adds to the pattern.
  - **The appeal draft is at `~/Documents/Code/notes/appeal-4-3-spam.md` (repo root, 113 lines) — NOT at `<repo>/~/Documents/Code/notes/appeal-4-3-spam.md`.** Several roadmap lines point at the per-repo path; that file does not exist in any of the five repos. Fix the pointer, do not write a second draft.
  - **Status: DRAFTED, NOT FILED.** Filing is Resolution Center, which is browser-only (`asc web review` is read-only). Blocked on Joshua. Reply order in the draft is Talli, Curvely, Doorstock; hold Sparkjar and NYC Survive.
  - Verified via API 2026-08-27: submission is UNRESOLVED_ISSUES with a single appStoreVersion item REJECTED — no phantom-IAP item, so the "mislabeled inAppPurchaseVersion" trap does not apply. `asc validate` and `asc review doctor` are otherwise clean, confirming this is a guideline call and not a readiness gap.
